      "Content of a page: 10% a week. And while 110 may not seem much better than 100,if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how bigthe numbers get. After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after2 years you'll have 2 million.You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users athousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually. Butif the market exists you can usually start by recruiting usersmanually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. [3]Airbnb is a classic example of this technique. Marketplaces are sohard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measuresat first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door inNew York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improvetheir listings. When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picturethem with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesdaydinners they'd always just flown back from somewhere.FragileAirbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on itwas so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging inperson with users made the difference between success andfailure.That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb. Almost allstartups are fragile initially. And that's one of the biggest thingsinexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them. They unconsciously judgelarval startups by the standards of established ones. They're likesomeone looking at a newborn baby and concluding \"there's noway this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything.\"It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.They always get things wrong. It's even ok if investors dismissyour startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth.The big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself. I'veseen it happen. I often have to encourage founders who don't seethe full potential of what they're building. Even Bill Gates madethat mistake. He returned to Harvard for the fall semester afterstarting Microsoft. He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't havereturned at all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even afraction of the size it turned out to be. [4]The question to ask about an early stage startup is not \"is thiscompany taking over the world?\" but \"how big could this companyget if the founders did the right things?\" And the right thingsoften seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time.Microsoft can't have seemed very impressive when it was just acouple guys in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for amarket of a few thousand hobbyists (as they were then called),but in retrospect that was the optimal path to dominatingmicrocomputer software. And I know Brian Chesky and JoeGebbia didn't feel like they were en route to the big time as theywere taking \"professional\" photos of their first hosts' apartments.They were just trying to survive. But in retrospect that too wasthe optimal path to dominating a big market.How do you find users to recruit manually? If you build somethingto solve your own problems, then you only have to find yourpeers, which is usually straightforward. Otherwise you'll have to8/6/24, 11:04 AMDo Things that Don't Scale\n",

A lot of would-be founders believethat startups either take off or don't. You build something, makeit available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat apath to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case themarket must not exist. [1]Actually startups take off because the founders make them takeoff. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, butusually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A goodmetaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before theygot electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keepgoing, but there was a separate and laborious process to get itgoing.RecruitThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at thestart is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. Youcan't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and getthem.Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, andthe problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could havesat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they'refamous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.Startups building things for other startups have a big pool ofpotential users in the other companies we've funded, and nonetook better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the term\"Collison installation\" for the technique they invented. Morediffident founders ask \"Will you try our beta?\" and if the answer\n"
